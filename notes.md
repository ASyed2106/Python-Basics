### What is python?
- An high-level and interpreted programming language that is used to code programs.

#### Characteristics üê∏
** A High-level Language**:
    - (source code that must be translated to machine level code for execution)
**Interpreted Language: **
    - Executed line by line until it meets an error
**Interactive Interpreter:**
    - Can test lines of code on its interpreter
**Object-Oriented **

### Commenting
    - A way to leave human-readable notes for the reader. Often used to explain your coding and variable naming philosophy
    
### Documentation
     - The multi-line commenting feature will often used to describe your self-made functions or objects
     - Not often used for other types of code.

### Variables
`   -  In Python, we can assign different types of built-in data type to a label, which we call a ‚Äúvariable‚Äù
    - We use singular equal sign to assign a value to a variable.

### Naming Conventions
    - **Avoid** using single letters to denote variable names
    - **Avoid** starting variable names with numbers
    - Variable names **should** be short, but reflective of what the variable contains
    - Spaces should be avoided and multi-word variable should use either **camelCasing or under_scores** 
                - (camelCasing is where different words are separated by capitalization)
    - Avoid using special/reserved keywords of a programming language
    - Don‚Äôt start variable names with capitals

### input()
    - The input function halts the program until an input has been entered into the program.
    - The input function can have an empty parameter; however, we can add string messages to output before we receive an input
            - This is called a prompt

### Conditionals
    - Any non-zero and non-null values evaluate to True
    - 1 is True
    - 0 is False
    
#### if statements
    - one of the most common ways to handle conditional
    - if statements will execute its own block of code iff its own boolean expression evaluates to **True**.
    
#### if else statements
    - when the if‚Äôs boolean expression is False, the else‚Äôs code block will be executed
          - This is very powerful for binary decisions.
    - also very clean coding practice to make sure that the program knows how to handle situations when the boolean_expression evaluates to False.
#### if elif else
    - Sometimes there can be multiple conditionals rather than a binary condition
        -  Your Boolean expressions should all be related to each other. 
            - If not... just start a new if statement.
### range()
    - A function that generates a sequence of numbers in an arithmetic progression. 
        - range(start,end-step,step)
### Iterations
    - Iteration: the act of repeating a mathematical or computational process.
#### Why we iterate üê∏
    - Generate unbounded sequence of outcomes
    - Approach a desired goal/target/result

**All For Loops can be turned to While Loops, but not the other way around**

#### while loop
    - A conditional based iteration that repeats its block of code iff its boolean expression is **true**.
##### Infinite while loop
    - Infinite While Loops is an iteration technique that **never** ends. 
    - The boolean expression in the while loop is never affected by the while loop code block, and it always evaluates to True.
        - WHILE LOOP NEVER BECOMES FALSE
            - useful for gaming 
 ##### while else 
    - Python 3 also also allows while ‚Ä¶ else. 
    - The else‚Äôs code block only executes **if** the while‚Äôs boolean expression evaluates to False.
    
 ``` python 
  num = 10
  while num != 10:
	print(‚ÄúThe number is:‚Äù, num)
	num -= 1
  else:
	print(‚ÄúThe number is now:‚Äù, num)
  ```
  ##### flag based while loops
    - Flag: a value that acts as a signal for a function or process
   ``` python
num = 2
flag = True
while flag:
	print(num)
	num **= 2
	user_input = input(‚ÄòExit? (Y/N): ‚Äò)
	if user_input in ‚ÄòYy‚Äô:
		flag = False
   ```
   #### for loops
    -  a iteration through items within a sequence. The variable will hold the item value for each iteration step.

### Functions
    - a block of organized, reusable code that is usually used to perform a **single** and **related action**.
            - There are built-in functions for languages
            - Most languages support you to create functions
                    - Similar Concepts or terms: methods, subroutines, procedures
#### Programming function üê∏
    - single input can be mapped to **different/multiple** output. 
    - Think of it as self contained module of code that is meant to accomplish a specific task
    
#### How does it work? 
    - A program may execute a function call
    - The program enters the function
    - All instructions within the function will executed from top to bottom
    - The program leaves the function and returns to the program‚Äôs flow
    - Any data computed and RETURNED by the function is used by the program

#### Why use functions? üê∏
    - **Reusability**: prevents you from repeating code that you‚Äôve written before
    - **Algorithms**: helps to create or formulate algorithms
    - **Clean Code**: organizes a solution into a function
    - **Single Serving**: a block of code that solves a single problem
