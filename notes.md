### What is python?
- An high-level and interpreted programming language that is used to code programs.

#### Characteristics üê∏
** A High-level Language**:
    - (source code that must be translated to machine level code for execution)
**Interpreted Language: **
    - Executed line by line until it meets an error
**Interactive Interpreter:**
    - Can test lines of code on its interpreter
**Object-Oriented **

### Commenting
    - A way to leave human-readable notes for the reader. Often used to explain your coding and variable naming philosophy
    
### Documentation
     - The multi-line commenting feature will often used to describe your self-made functions or objects. Not often used for other types of code.

### Variables
`   -  In Python, we can assign different types of built-in data type to a label, which we call a ‚Äúvariable‚Äù
    - We use singular equal sign to assign a value to a variable.

### Naming Conventions
    - **Avoid** using single letters to denote variable names
    - **Avoid** starting variable names with numbers
    - Variable names **should** be short, but reflective of what the variable contains
    - Spaces should be avoided and multi-word variable should use either **camelCasing or under_scores** (camelCasing is where different words are separated by capitalization)
    - Avoid using special/reserved keywords of a programming language
    - Don‚Äôt start variable names with capitals

### input()
    - The input function halts the program until an input has been entered into the program.
    - The input function can have an empty parameter; however, we can add string messages to output before we receive an input. This is called a prompt

### Conditionals
    - Any non-zero and non-null values evaluate to True
    - 1 is True
    - 0 is False
    
#### if statements
    - one of the most common ways to handle conditional
    - if statements will execute its own block of code iff its own boolean expression evaluates to **True**.
    
#### if else statements
    - when the if‚Äôs boolean expression is False, the else‚Äôs code block will be executed
          - This is very powerful for binary decisions.
    - also very clean coding practice to make sure that the program knows how to handle situations when the boolean_expression evaluates to False.
#### if elif else
    - Sometimes there can be multiple conditionals rather than a binary condition
        -  Your Boolean expressions should all be related to each other. 
            - If not... just start a new if statement.
