### Whats an object üçÑ 
    - In(CS) object can be a variable, a data structure, a function, or a method; therefore,
      a location in memory having a value that can be referenced by an identifier
    - In OOP is an instance of a class where this object can be either a variable, a function, a data structure or a combination of such
        - A combination of data and functional code. This is because real-world objects have states and behaviour.
### What is OOP
    - Programming practice to design modular reusable software systems
    - designs programs with creation of Objects
    - focuses on the definition of data rather than the input ‚Üí processing ‚Üí output logic
    - meant to create an object that can define/ provide functionality to solve problems

### Procedure vs OOP
Procedure oriented 
            A human may require:
            Calculations
            Logical Evaluations
            Complete Repetitive tasks
            Database
OOP
            What‚Äôs their name
            What‚Äôs their address
            What functions can this object have?
   
 **‚ÄúOOP focuses on how to manipulate the data of the object rather than the logic required to manipulate them‚Äù **

Object: A combination of data and functional code. This is because real-world objects have states and behaviour.

States: The characteristic, Measurable data of an object

Behaviour: The available functionality of the object (what can it do?)

Object‚Äôs Data ‚Üí called: attributes

Object‚Äôs Code ‚Üí called: methods

### Class
    - An abstract description of all objects that can be made from this set class where an object can be instantiated from.
    - A Class Contains Attributes
    - Attributes: An Object‚Äôs accessible tools
#### Creating a class
    1. First define the name of the class with the keyword: class
    2. In its code block (indentation) define its attributes
    3. Then you can assign a variable with an instantiation of the class to interact with it
    Make sure to use parentheses when calling the class name.

#### __init__ method 
    - The __init__ method (double underscores).
    - The initialization method is executed as soon as an object of the class is instantiated
    - It helps us to do any initialization for the object‚Äôs attributes
    - self parameter is used to denote that the method is applied and accessible for the object itself
    - self will also treat its own attributes as local
