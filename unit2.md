### Whats an object üçÑ 
    - In(CS) object can be a variable, a data structure, a function, or a method; therefore, a location in memory having a value that can be referenced by an identifier
    - In OOP is an instance of a class where this object can be either a variable, a function, a data structure or a combination of such
        - A combination of data and functional code. This is because real-world objects have states and behaviour.
